# spotweb_installer

Simple interactive Bash script to install Apache, MariaDB, PHP, phpMyAdmin and [Spotweb](https://github.com/spotweb/spotweb) in a Proxmox debian container with a selfsigned certificate.
I recommend at least a 30 GB debian container, but it depends on the retention of your usenet server provider and how you setup your database.
